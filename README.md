A Classic Descriptive Analysis of Netflix Content across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Turkey (Kaggle, 2019) as part of Cambridge Spark Practical Hackathon.




I'm thrilled to present my latest project from the Cambridge Spark - Practical Hackathon Bootcamp â€“ a Comparative Analysis of Netflix Content across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Turkey, using the Netflix Dataset from Kaggle (2019).

ðŸ“Š Project Overview:
In this project, I delved into the world of Netflix data, exploring trends, patterns, and insights across different regions. The dataset, though relatively tidy and small, provided a rich playground for some Python library magic on a Sunday evening.
